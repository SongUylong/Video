Here’s an expanded, clear, and well-structured version of each section, suitable for notes, assignments, or beginner-friendly learning material.

## How Does the Internet Work

The Internet works by connecting millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks into one global system. Devices such as computers, smartphones, and servers communicate using standardized protocols, primarily **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)**.

When you request a website, your device sends data packets through routers and switches across multiple networks. These packets may travel different paths and are reassembled at their destination. Servers then send the requested data back to your device in the same packet-based manner.

This system enables services such as web browsing, email, video streaming, online gaming, cloud computing, and real-time communication. The Internet acts as a worldwide infrastructure that allows instant access to information and digital services regardless of geographic location.

## What is HTTP?

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the core communication protocol used on the World Wide Web. It defines how browsers (clients) request data and how web servers respond to those requests.

HTTP is a **stateless protocol**, meaning each request is handled independently without remembering previous interactions. Common HTTP methods include:

- **GET** – retrieve data
- **POST** – send data
- **PUT** – update data
- **DELETE** – remove data

**HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** adds encryption using TLS/SSL, protecting data from interception and tampering. Modern versions like **HTTP/2** and **HTTP/3** improve performance by reducing latency, enabling multiplexing, and optimizing data delivery. Understanding HTTP is fundamental for web development and networking.

## Domain Name

A **domain name** is a human-readable address used to access websites, such as `google.com`. It replaces complex numerical **IP addresses** (e.g., `142.250.72.14`) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

Domain names are structured hierarchically:

- **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** `.com`, `.org`, `.net`
- **Second-Level Domain:** `google`
- **Subdomain (optional):** `www`

Domains are registered through accredited registrars and are crucial for branding, credibility, and online identity. The **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates these names into IP addresses so browsers can locate the correct server.

## Hosting

**Web hosting** is the service that stores website files (HTML, CSS, images, databases) on servers and makes them accessible via the Internet. When users visit a website, their browser retrieves these files from the hosting server.

Common types of hosting include:

- **Shared Hosting:** Multiple websites share the same server (cost-effective)
- **VPS Hosting:** Virtual private server with dedicated resources
- **Dedicated Hosting:** One server for a single website
- **Cloud Hosting:** Uses multiple servers for scalability and reliability

Hosting providers often include services like email hosting, domain registration, SSL certificates, backups, and security tools. Reliable hosting is essential for website speed, uptime, and user experience.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

The **DNS** functions like the Internet’s phone book. It translates human-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses so devices can communicate with the correct servers.

When you enter a website URL:

1. Your browser checks local cache
2. Queries DNS resolvers
3. Contacts authoritative DNS servers
4. Receives the IP address
5. Connects to the web server

DNS is a global, distributed system designed for speed, reliability, and redundancy. Without DNS, users would need to memorize IP addresses, making the Internet far less usable.

## Browsers

**Web browsers** are software applications that allow users to access and interact with websites. Popular browsers include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Browsers work by:

- Sending HTTP/HTTPS requests to servers
- Parsing **HTML** for structure
- Applying **CSS** for styling
- Executing **JavaScript** for interactivity

They use **rendering engines** (Blink, Gecko, WebKit) to display content and **JavaScript engines** (V8, SpiderMonkey) to run scripts. Browsers also manage security features, cookies, cache, bookmarks, extensions, and user privacy, making them essential tools for navigating the web.
